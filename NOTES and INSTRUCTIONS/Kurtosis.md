#Kurtosis
####Describes the sahpe of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable.
---
###- Leptokurtic Distribution (Positive)	
	- Highest rapid rise
	- Very less time on top
	- Heavy tails and sharp peak
	- Kurtosis value is higher than 3
	- Data has more outliers or extreme values than a normal distribution

###- Mesokurtic Distribution (Normal)	
	- Higher moderate rise
	- Moderate time on top
	- Tails and peaks are similar to a normal distribution (kurtosis = 3
	- Kurtosis value is same as normal distribution.

###- Platykurtic Distribution (Negative)	
	- Lowest slow rise  
	- Spends most time on top
	- Lighter tails and flatter peak than normal distribution.
	- Kurtosis value is lower than 3
	- Data has few outliers than a normal distribution

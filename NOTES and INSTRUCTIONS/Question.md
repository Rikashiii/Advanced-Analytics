Objective: Find the avg age of an Indian (Polulation mean = μ)

Ideal: Get the age if EVERY Indian and then cakculate the avg Popoulation. (Population mean = μ)
Population size (N) = ~140-150 crores

Problem: Practically difficult (impossible)
Solution: Take sample(s): 1 crore... Sample size (n)
Calculate the average age of the sample (Sample mean = xbar)

Using x bar (sample mean) we estimate μ (population mean)

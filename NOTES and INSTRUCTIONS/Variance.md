#Variance

**Variance** = How far are the data points from their mean?

- High Variance = Data is more scattered from its mean
- Low vairance = Data is less scattered from mean

#####Variance calculation:

	1. Find the mean of the given data set
	- Subtract the mean from each value and square the result. 
	--Why square?? To eradicate negative values and highlight Outliers
	- Add up the squared differences and divide by the total no of numbers: 
	--The average of these squared value is the variance.

#Standard Deviation
	- Square root of variance
	- The scale of vairantance

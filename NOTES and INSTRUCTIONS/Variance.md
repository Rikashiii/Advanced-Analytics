#Variance

**Variance** = How far are the data points from their mean?

- High Variance s= Data is more scattered from its mean
- Low vairance = Data is less scattered from mean
---
#####Variance calculation:

	1. Find the mean of the given data set
	- Subtract the mean from each value and square the result. 
	--Why square?? To eradicate negative values and highlight Outliers
	- Add up the squared differences and divide by the total no of numbers: 
	--The average of these squared value is the variance.
---

#Standard Deviation
	- Square root of variance
	- The scale of vairantance 
	- Easy to interpret than Variance.	
Purpose	- Measure the avg distance of data points from the mean in the same units as data.

##Variance

1. Calc mean
-  Subtract mean from each no
- square the result
- add up the squared differences and divide by the total no of numbers
---
	Standard Deviation = Square root of Variance

---
#####Standard deviation is used instead of variance because it is expressed in the same units as the original data, making it more intuitive and easier to interpret for a reader.
---
####How many standard deviations you are from the mean?
	Formula = Our data point - Mean
			 -----------------------
			  Standard Deviation

#Coefficient of Variation (CV)
	Formula =   Standard Deviation	 x 100
			   --------------------
			  		 Mean
- Expressed in %age.
- Independent of units of data (relative measure)

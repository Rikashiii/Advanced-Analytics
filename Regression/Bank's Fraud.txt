A bank's fraud detection system analyzed 1000 credit card transactions. Out of these, 400 transactions were flagged as fraudulent by the system. 
In reality, 350 transactions were actually fraudulent. Among the flagged transactions, 300 were truly fraudulent.
Based on this information, calculate the True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives
(FP), and False Negatives (FN), and construct the confusion matrix.
Step 1: True Positives (TP): Already given: TP = 300
This is the number of transactions correctly flagged as fraud.
Step 2: False Positives (FP): FP = Predicted Fraudulent: TP - FP = 400-300=100
These are legitimate transactions incorrectly flagged as fraud.
Step 3: False Negatives (FN): FN = Actually Fraudulent: TP - FN = 350-300 = 50
These are fraudulent transactions that the system missed.
Step 4: True Negatives (TN): TN= Total-(TP+FP+FN)=1000-(300+100+50)=550
These are legitimate transactions correctly identified as legitimate.
